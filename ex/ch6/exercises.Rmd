# Section 6.2.4 (Single page layout exercises)

## Ex1

According to `?sidebarLayout`, the main area of a sidebarLayout takes up 2/3
of the horizontal width (of the sidebarLayout). The columns of a fluidRow should
add up to 12. So, to recreate this:

```
sidebarLayout(
  sidebarPanel(...),
  mainPanel(...)
)
```

... using fluidRow would require code like this:

```
fluidRow(
  column(4, sidebarPanel(...)),
  column(8, mainPanel(...))
)
```

## Ex 2

(See also ./ex/ch3/clt; this exercise was moved out of the UI chapter into the
layouts chapter)

To put the sidebar on the right in the sidebarLayout you use
```
sidebarLayout(
  sidebarPanel = blah,
  mainPanel = blahblah,
  position = "right"
)
```

## Ex 3

Create an app that contains two plots, each of which takes up half of the width

(THis was done in ./ex/ch3/two-figures, this exercise was moved out of the UI
chapter into the layouts chapter)
